#Pooja would like to withdraw X $US from an ATM. The cash machine will only accept the transaction if X is a multiple of 5, and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction (including bank charges). For each successful withdrawal the bank charges 0.50 $US. Calculate Pooja's account balance after an attempted transaction.
balance = 1000
withdrawal_amount = int(input("Enter amount to withdraw: "))
if withdrawal_amount%5==0 and balance>withdrawal_amount+0.5:
    balance -= withdrawal_amount+0.5
    print('withdraw successful')
    print(balance)
else:
    print('withdraw unsuccessful')
