#Define a procedure histogram that takes a list of integers and prints a histogram to the screen. For example, histogram([4, 9, 7]) should print the following:
numlist = []
        
temp = 0
while temp != -1:
  temp = int(input("Input a number >= 0 to add to a histogram. Input -1 to stop."))
  if temp != -1:
    numlist.append(temp)
print(numlist)

def histogram(numlist):
  if numlist:
    for x in numlist:
      print("*"*x)
   
print(histogram(numlist))
