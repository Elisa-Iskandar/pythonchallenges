#An evil maths teacher has locked his students in school until they manage to type the first 100 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence. Can you think of a quicker way to do it in Python?
print(0)
print(1)
print(1)
print(2)
last = 2
last2 = 1
for x in range(96):
    print(last+last2)
    if x%2==0:
        last2 = (last+last2)
    else:
        last = (last+last2)
